							<h2>Hello Possums!</h2> <br><br><br>

						We are Reporter S and Reporter L, the creators of (and slaves to) the Sunshine K-Music website. 
						For many years we have both had an interest in Korean music, particularly pop, indie and traditional music 
						(Reporter S dreams of one day learning the gayageum), 
						and so we decided to create this website to share our knowledge and enthusiasm with the wider world! <br><br><br>

						In adding our voices to the "Korean-culture-content-for-English-speakers" corner of the Internet, we also wanted to add a bit of journalistic integrity to the area. 
						We both have seen fansites that make vague and misleading profiles of groups, and sites that write 'clickbait' headlines for content, 
						and it makes us angry. On our website, we will give credit and add links for all our sources, on all articles. 
						We will only publish content and information that we have been able to verify through official sources, 
						or through photos/fancams that were taken at official functions. We are not affiliated with or paid by any company to promote their music or products 
						(lol, if only we were that influential) and the comments and opinions we write based on sourced material is our own. <br><br><br>

						We are a website that respects the privacy and humanity of Korean artists, and so we will not publish articles about rumours or scandals,
						and also we will not publish invasive airport photos. <br><br><br>

						Korean music in all its rich variety has been like sunshine to both Reporter S and Reporter L during many dark and difficult times in our lives. 
						This website is our humble attempt at sharing our love and appreciation of Korean music with the world. <br><br><br>

						We hope you enjoy your time here, and if you want to help us financially, please follow this link to our Patreon page. <br><br><br>

							<h2>Reporter S – Bio</h2> <br><br> 

							Reporter S became curious about Korea after learning about King Sejong and the creation of Hangeul. <br>
							Now she is fascinated by all things Korean, particularly its food, language and geography. <br>
							When it comes to Kpop she is unashamedly multi-fandom and is noona to pretty much everyone, except Super Junior. <br><br>

							Reporter S is Australian, which is why you will see British/Australian spelling in all her articles. <br><br><br>

 

							<h2>Reporter L – Bio</h2> <br><br>
						

 
							Reporter L was born in Korea, went to school and university in Korea, got a job in a cosmetic e-commerce company in Korea.....then decided to run off to Australia to live her own life. <br>
							Reporter L has a discerning eye for Korean pop and indie music and it was her enthusiasm that led to the creation of this website. Founder of <a href="https://btskingdom.com">BTS Kingdom.</a>
